The Audio Definition COMMAND COLLECTION DUET closely follows the technological development and enclosure sophistication of the Statis. Being triangular in shape with non-parallel internal walls, the COMMAND COLLECTION DUET achieves superior transient response and mid-band clarity when compared to conventional rectangular style speakers.
DRIVERS
Two 165mm polypropylene cone bass/mid units, with inverted high-loss butyl rubber surrounds, injection moulded magnesium basket assemblies and 26mm copper and aluminium voice coils.
One 25mm vacuum formed soft-dome tweeter. The neodymium magnet allows a high quality driver in a very compact size. The construction of the magnet system gives very low magnetic stray fields being enclosed in a soft steel housing. The 26mm voice coil is immersed in magnetic fluid, allowing high power handling capacity and simplified crossover design.
The now established trade mark of Audio
Definition Loudspeakers
is the use of
D'Appolito driver configurations. The DUET is no exception using a true symmetrically arranged three-driver, time-aligned, point-source radiation pattern. This configuration has long been an industry standard for esoteric loudspeaker systems.
ENCLOSURES
Perhaps the most striking feature of this louds fermation hem is the reclosures, elimi
nation of internal parallel enclosure surfaces, thus negating internal standing wave effects.
All drive units are mounted on the front baffle board which is 25mm thick.
The drive units are then flush mounted in their own time domain and surrounded by a synthetic acoustic compound, eliminating unwanted diffraction effects.
The enclosures are substantially braced with a derivative of the Audio Definition internal aluminium matrix system. The use of 'Y' shaped extrusion fastened at 90° to the walls of the structure and terminating in the centre of the enclosures.


A 10mm thick bituminous compound in conjunction with the polyester resin and mineral compound poured onto internal walls, further dampens enclosure wall resonances to almost inaudible levels. Belore the resin and mineral compound achieves a solid state it settles in and around enclosure and brace joints greatly increasing strength and air
tightness. Upon achieving a solid state the compound is firmly adhered to the enclosure walls. The enclosures are then acoustically dampened with long fibre natural wool.
A 32mm thick bass plinth made from the same resin and mineral compound further enhances bass definition and mid-band clarity.
Finish is in piano gloss black.
CROSSOVERS
The DUET uses a 6dB per octave crossover for bass, and 12dB per octave for the high frequency network, with all series components critically matched. They are built as matched pairs. Crossover components are the same quality as used in all other Audio Definition Loudspeakers and include large diameter air core inductors and high voltage polypropylene capacitors which are configured as direct con-nect, hard-wired circuits.

# SUGGESTED SPEAKER POSITIONING
The correct positioning of a Loudspeaker in any given listening room will always, to some

The correct positioning of a Loudspeaker in any given listening room will always, to some extent, be a compromise between achieving the best sound quality and that which is aesthetically pleasing.
The basic starting point is that a room be acoustically dead. ie: if you were to clap your hands or speak in your intended listening room, and you were able to hear reflected sounds greater than one-half the loudness of the direct sound, the room is too reverberant. By repeating this process in different positions throughout the room you should be able to determine the direction and source of the loudest reflections. It then becomes quite an easy task to treat the offending surfaces with absorbing material. The addition of padded furniture can often transform a poor acoustic environment into a listening room of pleasing properties.
POSITIONS TO AVOID
• In the corners of a room.
• In the centre of a room.
• Equal distance from back wall as from side wall.
• Flat against a wall.
• Non symmetrical positioning such as one speaker one speaker near an archway and the Other near a solid wall.
PREFERRED POSITIONS
Best Bass Response
• Position speakers along the shortest wall in the room.
Place speakers approximately 1m from rear wall and 1m to 2m from side walls.
Speakers should be approximately 2m to 3m apart.
• Angle speakers in towards centre listening position 20' to 30.
Best Stereo Imaging and Sound Stage Width.
• Position speakers along the longest wall in the room.
Place speakers approximately 700mm from rear wall and 2m to 3m from side wall.
Speakers should be approximately 3m apart.
Angle speakers in toward centre listening position 20 to 30.
It will no doubt take some experimentation to achieve the best suited listening position for each speaker placement. Take special note that depending upon the distance of the listening position from the speakers you may increase or decrease the distance the speakers are apart to achieve a compromise between stereo imaging and the width of the sound stage.

Audio Definition is located in Port Macquarie's Industrial Estate and is dedicated to the design and manufacture of High Quality Loudspeakers.
The birth of Audio Definition, or should we say, the first time product was commercially available happened in 1988. The Company came about primarily as an offshoot from one of the Mid North Coast of NSW largest and longest established Cabinet and Joinery Manufacturers, Est 1960.
The directors of Audio Definition have both had life long interests in music, their families being personally involved in professional musical performances and the manufacture of musical instruments over the past two generations.
Since the introduction of Audio Definition product onto the consumer market in 1988 as a small offshoot of a major manufacturing concern, the company has gone from strength to strength and now occupies some 50 per cent of the Port Macquarie based factory. What started as a one speaker model line-up with complementary cabinetry in 1988 has grown to be a major moving force in the Australian Audio Industry with no less than seven models being marketed under the Audio Definition Brand Name and several brands being manufactured under contact to other companies.
The reasoning behind the development of Audio Definition was to bring to existence an Australian Manufactured Audiophile Quality range of Loudspeakers to enable the Australian buying public to obtain such a product at a price not burdened with transport, import, distribution and other associated costs indicative of all imported loudspeakers. To accomplish Audio Definition's superior pricing structure the company goes to great lengths to ensure all possible aspects of the development of it's product is done in house.
The design, manufacture and distribution of the product is handled by the
directors creating cost effectiveness in every facet of the products conception.
The Audio Definition philosophy of 'Uncompromising Form and Function' is achieved by strict adherence to the following points:
• Extremely tight control over the product's manufacture, distribution and sale.
• Escalating buying power of raw materials due to company development.
• Ever increasing sophistication in manufacturing and distribution.
• Improving trade factors with overseas suppliers (direct dealing with overseas manufacturers).
Development of computer aided design techniques. (Audio Definition utilize some of the world's most sophisticated computer design programs.)
To sum up Audio Definition's rapid development, and existing standing, in an extremely competitive and ever changing market place is perhaps a tall task, suffice to say, the company is privy to over thirty years of manufacturing and marketing expertise. From a strong financial base, the future of Audio Definition looks promising in Australia and Overseas.
Thank you for buying a pair of Audio Definition Loudspeakers.
